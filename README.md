# BrewTroller Compiler Service

The BrewTroller Compiler Service is the server side component of the cloud compilation service that enables BrewTroller Update. The cloud compiler service watches the BrewTroller Official repository for new versions of code, and automatically makes them available for installation to BrewTrollers via the BrewTroller Update utility.
